# Project Euler 20: Factorial Digit Sum

## Problem 20

n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

## Solution

This problem seems like a simple problem with a straightforward solution. However, in `c++`, with no `BigInter` class or something similar, it takes a manual approach to handle such big numbers. Using $log$ identity
$$\log 100! \leq \log 100^{100} \leq 100 \cdot \log 100 \leq 200,$$ we can savely assume that $100!$ is way bigger than the standard integer types provided with `c++`, but not bigger than $10^{200}$.

### Python solution

I obtained a solution to the problem in `python` in no time to solve the problem fast.

```python
import math

sum(map(int,str(math.factorial(100))))
```

### c++ solution

While more efficient solutions for handling big numbers exist, for this problem using a standard vector is fast enough. Since we know that $100!$ will have at most 200 digits, we can preserve this memory in order to avoid constant re-allocation. The rest of this solution is standard multiplication and carry handling.

This solution also passed all testcases on [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler020/problem).

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef std::vector<int> bigNum;

bigNum bigFactorial(int fac)
{
	bigNum result = {1}; // index 0 points to LSB of result
	result.reserve(200);
	for (int i = 2; i <= fac; ++i)
	{
		int carry = 0;  // we have to handle carries manually
		for (auto &d : result)
		{
			d = d * i + carry;
			if (d >= 10)
			{
				carry = d / 10;
				d %= 10;
			}
			else
			{
				carry = 0;
			}
		}
		while (carry > 0)
		{
			result.push_back(carry % 10);
			carry /= 10;
		}
	}
	return result;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	bigNum pe20 = bigFactorial(100);
	int64_t sum = 0;
	for (auto &d : pe20)
		sum += d;
	std::cout << "Solution to PE 20: " << sum << endl;
}
```
