# Project Euler 30: Digit fith powers

  >Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits;
>
  >1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44
   > 8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
 >  9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44
   > As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
>
>    The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

 >   Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

## Solution

The solution to this problem is just brute force, checking all numbers up to upper bound if the fifth powers of their digits add up to the number itself. The only challenging part of the problem is to find an upper bound.

The largest power is $9^5$. For a number with $n$ digits, in order to be a candidate for our task, following statement has to be true:
$$10^{n-1} \leq n \cdot 9^5 < 10^n.$$
Applying the rules of logarithm we finally end up with
$$ n-\log n \leq 5,77 \wedge n - \log n > 4,77 \\\ \implies n = 6.$$
The largest possible number with 6 digits is $6\cdot9^5=354.294.$ With a proper upper bound we can now just brute force our way to the solution and check for each number whether it is the sum of the fifth powers of its digits. In order to improve the perfomance, the fifth powers are precomputed and stored in a vector / list.
